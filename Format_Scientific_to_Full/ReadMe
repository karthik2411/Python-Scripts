README for Scientific Notation to Full Number Formatting Script

Description

This script contains a function that formats numbers in scientific notation to their full number representation. It does so by removing the decimal point and any trailing zeros from the number if they exist.

How to Use

1. Ensure you have a DataFrame (or Pandas Series) containing the numbers you want to format in scientific notation. In this README, we'll assume you have a DataFrame named `df`.

2. Import the required packages:

   ```python
   import pandas as pd

Define the function in your script:

def format_scientific_to_full(value):
    parts = value.split('.')
    if len parts == 2:
        # If the value has a decimal point, remove trailing zeros
        integer_part, decimal_part = parts
        return integer_part.rstrip('0')
    else:
        # If there's no decimal point, return the original value
        return value

Apply the function to the desired column (in this example, we're using a column named 'Number'):

df['Number'] = df['Number'].apply(format_scientific_to_full)
